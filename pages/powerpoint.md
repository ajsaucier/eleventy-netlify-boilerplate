## Principles

* Ensure **_font size is sufficient._** If your presentation will be viewed on a projector, font size may need to be even larger.
* Provide **_sufficient contrast._** If your presentation will be viewed on a projector, sometimes the contrast needs to be even more pronounced.
* Do not use color as **_the only way_** to convey meaning.
* Avoid **_automatic slide transitions._**
* Use **_simple slide transitions_** when possible.
* Do not put accessibility information like alternative text in the _Notes_ pane.
* If you have embedded video, ensure it is **_captioned._**
* If you have embedded audio, **_include a transcript._**
* If your slides contain animations, ensure they are **_brief and do not distract_** from the most important content on the page.
* Use **_simple_** language.

## Slide Layouts

Use slide layouts provided within PowerPoint to ensure files have **_correctly structured headings and lists_**, and **_proper reading order._**

1. Select _Home > New Slide_, then choose a layout from the dropdown.
2. To change a slide layout, select _Home > Layout_, then choose a layout from the dropdown.

## Reading Order

If you _Insert_ other content (e.g, a text box) it will be read by a screen reader in the order it is added to the page. It is important to keep this in mind whenever anything is added to a slide, since the visual reading order will not match the order read by assistive technologies until it is adjusted manually.

To check or fix reading order, select _Home > Arrange > Selection Pane_. Reading order is shown in reverse, **_bottom to top._** Click and drag or use the arrow buttons to change reading order.

## Alternative Text

Images should be given **_appropriate_** [**_alternative text_** (external link)](https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext) in PowerPoint. This Alt text is read by a screen reader in a PowerPoint file and should remain intact when exporting to HTML or a tagged PDF.

1. Right-click on the image and choose _Format Picture_.
2. Select the _Size & Properties_ icon and choose _Alt Text_.
3. Enter appropriate Alt text only in the _Description_ field (not the _Title_ field).

Alternatively, double-click on the image and the Alt Text option will appear in the Picture Format toolbar at the top of the application.
