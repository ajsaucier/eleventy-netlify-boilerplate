## Video Demonstration

This document was developed for faculty in the Connecticut Community Colleges as a quick guide to accompany the short demonstration video available on YouTube, entitled: **“Add Mechanical Fidelity Captions to Your Videos.”**

To access this video, please visit this our [Kaltura video playlist on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmAFsK4a4rSbNVvNcOuomJoWT0NTy08kN)**.**

**_Note:_** _We strongly recommend that you watch the video first, so you can see a quick (six minute) overview of the entire process, which will provide some context for the navigation in My Media. Then the following step-by-step instructions will then walk you through the process._

## Scenario

An instructor wishes to add automatically generated captions to a video that is available to their students in Blackboard, using the Kaltura media tool. He can either add captions to a video that has already been uploaded into his “My Media” area in Kaltura, or a new video can be added to “My Media” and have captions added to it.

### How to Navigate to the Kaltura “My Media” repository from Blackboard’s My Institution page

**Important:** The only way to add or edit Mechanical Fidelity captions is by navigating to the “My Media” Kaltura repository from the My Institution page. You cannot add captions if you navigate to My Media from within a Blackboard course.

Although it is possible to view all _My Media_ content by navigating to it from within a Blackboard course shell, you cannot add or edit mechanical fidelity captions that way.

1. Log in and launch Blackboard.
2. In the CT Community Colleges, users land on the “My Institution” page.
3. Click on the “Kaltura My Media” subtab near the top left of the window.

4. Click the “My Media” module link. This opens the “My Media” media repository for the user, where ALL of the videos that I have uploaded, for any course, are stored.

### How to Upload a Video to Kaltura “My Media” Mechanical

If the video you wish to add captions to has not previously been uploaded into My Media, follow these steps. If it has already been uploaded into _My Media_ (whether or not it has been linked to your courses), you can skip this step.

1. Click “Add New.”
2. Click “Media Upload.”

3. Click “Choose a file to upload.”  
   ![Screenshot showing Upload Media heading and Choose a file to upload button](/static/img/kaltura-screenshot-3.jpg)
4. Navigate to the video file you want to add captions to, select it, and open it.
   1. Be sure the name you give the video matches the title referenced in your Syllabus or elsewhere in your course.
5. Scroll down the page and click “Save.”
6. Then click “Go to My Media” to return to the _My Media_ tool.

### How to Request Mechanical Fidelity Captions for a Video

1. When you go into the **My Media** tool, you will be looking at your list of videos. From the list of videos, click the blue title link of the video you want to add captions to.  
   ![Screenshot of the My Media tool page showing the title of a video next to the video's thumbnail. The title is outlined with a red border.](/static/img/kaltura-screenshot-5.jpg)
2. Click the “Actions” button, and select “Order Captions.”  
   ![Screenshot of a video page with the Actions button activated, which shows a dropdown with various options. The Order Captions option in the list is outlined with a red border.](/static/img/kaltura-screenshot-6.jpg)
3. The only option you will see here is “Mechanical (70 to 80% accuracy)”. Click “Order Captions.”  
   ![Screenshot showing a select list with the label Fidelity. One option is available and selected. The Order Captions button is outlined with a red border.](/static/img/kaltura-screenshot-7.jpg)
4. A confirmation screen will display. Click “OK.”  
   ![Screenshot of confirmation message after ordering captions. The text in the confirmation is "Thank You! Your caption request has been received. Captions will be automatically uploaded to your video upon completion."](/static/img/kaltura-screenshot-8.jpg)
5. You will see information about the caption order status. As the process is working, you will first see a Status saying it is _Authorizing_, then _Processing_, and eventually _Complete_.

**Note:** It can take some time for captions to process—depending upon the length of the video. So you may wish to leave “My Media” to do some other work. Then you can navigate back to “My Media” later to continue review and editing the captions once processing is complete.
