## Video Demonstration

This document was developed for faculty in the Connecticut Community Colleges as a quick guide to accompany the short demonstration video available on YouTube, entitled: **“Add Mechanical Fidelity Captions to Your Videos.”**

To access this video, please visit this our [Kaltura video playlist on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmAFsK4a4rSbNVvNcOuomJoWT0NTy08kN)**.**

**_Note:_** _We strongly recommend that you watch the video first, so you can see a quick (six minute) overview of the entire process, which will provide some context for the navigation in My Media. Then the following step-by-step instructions will then walk you through the process._

## Scenario

An instructor wishes to add automatically generated captions to a video that is available to their students in Blackboard, using the Kaltura media tool. He can either add captions to a video that has already been uploaded into his “My Media” area in Kaltura, or a new video can be added to “My Media” and have captions added to it.

### How to Navigate to the Kaltura “My Media” repository from Blackboard’s My Institution page

**Important:** The only way to add or edit Mechanical Fidelity captions is by navigating to the “My Media” Kaltura repository from the My Institution page. You cannot add captions if you navigate to My Media from within a Blackboard course.

Although it is possible to view all _My Media_ content by navigating to it from within a Blackboard course shell, you cannot add or edit mechanical fidelity captions that way.

1. Log in and launch Blackboard.
2. In the CT Community Colleges, users land on the “My Institution” page.
3. Click on the “Kaltura My Media” subtab near the top left of the window.

4. Click the “My Media” module link. This opens the “My Media” media repository for the user, where ALL of the videos that I have uploaded, for any course, are stored.

### How to Upload a Video to Kaltura “My Media” Mechanical

If the video you wish to add captions to has not previously been uploaded into My Media, follow these steps. If it has already been uploaded into _My Media_ (whether or not it has been linked to your courses), you can skip this step.
