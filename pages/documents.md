## Using the Check Accessibility tool

Use the Check Accessibility tool to determine accessibility issues with your document and follow the prompts to fix issues.  The Check Accessibility tool is located under File > Info > Check for Issues in Microsoft Word 2016 and under Review in Office 365.

## Eight ways to create a more accessible Microsoft Word Document. 

### Add a Document Title

File Tab > Title field (at right of screen)

### Use Word Heading Styles

When adding headings to a Word document, do not use regular paragraph text styled to look like a heading. Doing this will not provide semantic meaning to a screen reader. Instead, use the actual heading styles provided by Word. 

Home Tab > Styles Group > Select “Heading 1”, “Heading 2”, “Heading 3”, etc.

Each Heading Style should match the logical heading structure of the document.

If you would rather use a style different than the default ones provided by Word, follow these steps:

1. Write text and apply desired styling
2. Highlight text and right click on the desired heading level in the toolbar
3. Select the "Update Heading to Match Selection" option

From that point forward, whenever you write new text and apply that heading level to it, that style will automatically be used. The same steps can be followed for any heading level. Always make sure that the heading is using a standard, easily readable font and good color contrast with the background.

### Use Word List Structure

- Home Tab > Paragraph Group > Bullets (for bulleted list)
- Home Tab > Paragraph Group > Numbering (for basic numbered list)
- Home Tab > Paragraph Group > Multilevel list (for more complex numbered list)

### Add Alternative Text to Meaningful Images and Figures

Alternative Text conveys the intended meaning of an image or figure. If an image is purely for decoration, either consider removing it from the document or choosing "Mark as decorative" checkbox when editing its alt text.
