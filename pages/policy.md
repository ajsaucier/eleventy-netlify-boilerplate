**Important:** this is a DRAFT version of the policy last updated on August 10, 2020.

## Background and Rationale

The Connecticut State Colleges and Universities (CSCU) provides equal opportunity to its educational and administrative services, programs and activities in accordance with federal and state law. CSCU is committed to ensuring equal access to information, programs, and activities through its information technologies, web pages, web-based applications, operating system-based applications, digital instructional content, services, and resources (“electronic information and technology” or “EIT”). Therefore, digital information, websites, technology, coursework, and email need to be accessible by all in an understandable way. This is in accordance with federal and state laws including the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), and the Amendments Act of 2008, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Section 508 of the 1973 Rehabilitation Act as amended and the State of Connecticut’s Universal Website Accessibility Policy for state websites.

## Purpose of the Policy

The purpose of this policy is to establish standards for the accessibility of EIT considered necessary to ensure compliance with applicable local, state and federal regulations and laws. This policy ensures that all digital information (EIT) is designed, developed, and procured to be accessible to all individuals with disabilities.

## Implementation of the Policy

CSCU Institutions are required to develop local procedures to implement, monitor and ensure compliance to the established standards in this policy.

## Enforcement of the Policy

Enforcement of this policy is the responsibility of institutional and system leadership.

## Compliance of the Policy

All CSCU administrators, faculty, staff, and students are responsible for fulfilling the requirements of the policy.

Non-compliance may result in barriers that impact students’ ability to succeed within our institutions as well as faculty or staff members’ ability to successfully complete their duties. If those actions are deemed in violation of applicable laws, the responsible individual, institution, or system may be at risk for litigation or loss of federal funding.

## Policy Statement

This policy extends to the electronic information and technologies used in administrative services and in and out of the classroom, and applies to their procurement, design, development, implementation, ongoing maintenance and use. Ensuring equal and effective electronic information and technology access is the responsibility of all CSCU administrators, faculty, staff and students.

_The review of this policy will occur biennially._

## Definitions

"Accessible” means that individuals with disabilities are able to independently acquire the same information, engage in the same interactions, and enjoy the same services within the same timeframe as individuals without disabilities, with substantially equivalent ease of use.

“Archived EIT” refers to EIT developed, maintained, procured, materially revised, or hosted by the institution before this Policy’s effective date and is retained by the institution solely for informational or regulatory purposes.

“Disability” means a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities.

“Electronic information and technology" or "EIT" includes information technology and any equipment or interconnected system or subsystem of equipment that is used in the creation, conversion, or duplication of data or information. The term includes, but is not limited to, the internet and intranet websites, content delivered in digital form; including, but not limited to, word processing documents, PDFs, presentations, publications, and spreadsheets which are scanned, uploaded, posted, or otherwise published or distributed electronically, electronic books and electronic book reading systems, search engines and databases, learning management systems, classroom technology and multimedia, and personal response systems ("clickers"). It also includes any equipment or interconnected system or subsystem of equipment that is used in the automatic acquisition, creation, storage, manipulation, management, movement, control, display, switching, interchange, transmission, or reception of data or information. This term includes telecommunication products (such as telephones), information kiosks, Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) transaction machines, computers, ancillary equipment, software, firmware and similar procedures, services (including support services), and related resources. In cases where multiple telecommunication devices exist within the same location (and it is not reasonable to ensure all devices meet policy standards), at least one telecommunication device must be accessible. Experimental electronic information and technology in a production environment are not exempt from this policy.
