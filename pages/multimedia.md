There are four main methods of making video and audio content accessible for as many people as possible:

* **Captions:** Text synchronized with the media, for people who cannot hear the spoken words. There are two common types of captions:
  * **Closed Captions:** Captions that can be turned on or off by the user and can often be customized to the user's preference for things like font size, font and background color, and more.
  * **Open Captions:** Captions that are burned in as part of the file and cannot be turned off or customized by the user.
* **Transcripts:** The full text of the spoken words and important visual information in the media file, to read as an alternative to watching or listening to the media file.
* **Audio descriptions:** A version of the media file with a narrator explaining important visual information (such as unspoken actions and events) for the benefit of people who cannot see what's happening.
* **Sign language interpretation:** Video of an interpreter, synchronized with the media file (or in the same video frame), for the benefit of people who know sign language.

## Important Considerations

There are additional aspects to multimedia files that are important to consider when creating and sharing a file with students as part of course content.

* **Clear audio:** Prominent background sounds make it difficult for people who are hard of hearing to understand the spoken words.
* **Preventing seizures:** Flashing visual effects in videos can cause seizures in some people, especially when three or flashes occur per second.
* **Preventing dizziness:** Some people with vestibular disorders can become dizzy, nauseous, or disoriented when there is excessive motion in video or animated content.
* **Accessible media player:** The media player itself has to be keyboard-accessible and needs to communicate the names, roles, and values of the controls and the states of the controls to assistive technology.
* **Preventing auto-play audio interference with screen readers:** Media players that auto-play can interfere with screen reader users' ability to hear what their screen reader is saying, and could render the content impossible to use if it lacks the ability to pause or stop it.
